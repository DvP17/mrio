# Work with MRIO data

This R-package provides various calculation methods for environmentally-extended multi-regional inputâ€“output (EE-MRIO) analysis. It includes different characterization factors.

* currently supports Exiobase3 and Eora
* calculate:
  + **b**iodiversity **l**oss ``"bl"`` (currently only for Exiobase)
  + **b**lue **w**ater consumption ``"bw"`` (currently only for Exiobase)
  + **c**limate **c**hange impacts ``"cc"``
  + **en**ergy demand ``"en"``
  + **l**and **u**se ``"lu"``
  + **m**aterial **f**ootprint ``"mf"``
  + **w**ater **s**tress ``"ws"``
* calculate:
  + **p**roduction to **d**emand matrix ``"pd"``
  + **p**roduction to target **d**emand matrix ``"no-double-pt"``
  + **t**arget to final **s**upply matrix ``"no-double-ts"``
  + **t**arget to final **d**emand matrix ``"no-double-td"``
  + **p**roduction to final **d**emand matrix ``"no-double-pd"``
* create country-dyads



## First Steps

Before you begin, set your working directory to the path where you store your Eora and Exiobase files:

``setwd("C:/Data/Exiobase)``


## Plan

- include Exio 1995 data for dyad construction
- add WIOD
- add bl and ws for Eora
- automated download of the data sets
